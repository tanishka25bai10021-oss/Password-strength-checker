# Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users create accounts across multiple platforms, often using weak or easily guessable passwords. This leads to security risks such as unauthorized access, data leaks, and cyber-attacks. Many users are unaware of what makes a password secure.
This project aims to help users evaluate the strength of their passwords and encourage them to create stronger and safer credentials.
# Scope of the Project
The project checks a password against essential security criteria such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
It provides real-time feedback indicating pass/fail for each requirement.
It concludes with an overall strength result (Strong or Weak).
It is a lightweight Python-based tool suitable for learning and basic security awareness.
Note: This project does not store passwords or perform advanced hashing or encryption checks.
